    <h1>Red Alert - shopping priority list<h1>
<p>This simple app allows you to set alerts for things you need to buy so you don\'t forget.
The alerts will show up as notifications in your phones\' bar and on the lock screen and will stay there until you
remove the notification or the alert itself.</p>
<p>I hope you find this useful, I certainly do :)</p>

<p><b>Alert levels (colors)</b></p>
<p>Each alert has a level (color). The colors are used to order them - red - orange - yellow.
For instance use a red alert for something you urgently need (you\'ve just ran out of toothpaste),
an orange one for something you\'ll need in the near future (you\'ve just opened the last box of cereals)
and a yellow alert for that spare light bulb you know you\'ll need someday.</p>
<p><b>Adding an alert</b></p>
Simply click on one of the buttons which coresponds to the desired color and fill in the name of the item that you need
and the name of the store that you find that item.<br>
The app will autocomplete the item name based on the previous alerts you had.
<p><b>Removing/editing an alert</b></p>
<p>Long click on one alert and it will open a context menu. Choose the desired action:
<br>
- Delete - removes the alert and the notification<br>
- Make red/orange/yellow - change the alert level<br>
</p>
<p><b>Removing all alerts</b></p>
<p>Click on the button on lower right corner and choose OK when the dialog shows up.</p>
<p><b>Autocomplete</b></p>
<p>The app keeps a list of the previous alerts and it will autocomplete the item as you type. Once you decide to choose an item from the
suggestions, it will autocomplete the store name based on some criteria. You can always ovewrite the store name with something else.</p>
